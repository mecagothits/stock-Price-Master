Time Series Forecasting with External Influences: A Transformer-Based Approach

Project Overview

Build a Transformer-based model to forecast stock prices using both historical price data and external signals (related time series, news sentiment, etc.) using TensorFlow's Transformer architecture.

Why It's Challenging

Involves sequence modeling over temporal data plus handling multivariate inputs (lags, exogenous variables)
Requires adapting Transformer attention mechanisms to continuous numeric data—not just discrete tokens
May incorporate positional encoding, learned embeddings for continuous features, and forecast horizons
